# first time
use two var and change the directions

<font color='red'>can do it again</font>

I first use dummynode to do this, but it shows that there is a circle.
so **pre must be null(because it is the final ListNode->next)**

# second time

can do it by myself, but there is one thing:

pre=None instead of pre=ListNode(None)
