to solve this question, we need to use Linked List

**the process are as follows:**

>+ if l1 or l2 is null, return the other one
>+ traversal every digit of l1 and l2,use privalue to record the carry
>+ traversal the remaining one(l1 or l2)

1. one thing need to pay attation is the Formula！！！
   check each formula
2. we use cur=dummy=ListNode(), cur is moving all the time and dummy is not move.
   at the end of function, all we need to do is dummy.next
