binary tree traversal recursion and backtrack

<font color='red'>need to do it again!!</font>

use the method of recursion and backtrack, similar to problem 257, and add a number to record additionally.

# second time

I know I should use backtrack, but I don't know the framework of backtrace, so still need to do a third time.
