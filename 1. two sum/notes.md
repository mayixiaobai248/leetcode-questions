I write the question using python, to solve the problem, we need to use hash table related data structure.

In python, I use dict() to complete this, something to review are  as follows:

**1.  the dict()**

>+ A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values that holds **key-value pairs**.
>+ create dict: my_dict = dict().
>+ add some new key and value: my_dict['new_key'] = 'new_value'
