#first time
wirte the first version of code in five min, but not pass.

finally, I found that **I have two problems**:
>+ nums[i]>nums[stack[-1]], mention that the mono syack stores the index of number.
>+ final_result=result[:length], get the list from [0] to [length-1]

#second time
done in 5 min and pass
